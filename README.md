DATATABEL Churn Rate

TASK:
The task was to analyse why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Databel.
DATA:
The churn dataset is a fictitious dataset for a Telecom provider called Databel. 
It consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer. I was analysing a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time (there was no time dimension).
FINDINGS:
Three main KPIs are the number of customers (6687), the number of churned customers (1796), and the churn rate (26.86%).
The average churn rate is relatively high.
The churn rate in California is abnormally high at 63.24% while its number of customer service calls is relatively low (44) 
The churn rate is strongly related to competitors. It is also impacted by the type of contract and the customer's age.

While setting the condition to Month-to-Month contract type, the churn rate goes up to 46%, and almost 1600 out of 1800 churners come from this group.
When we select the Two-year contract, on the other hand, the churn rate drops to a very low 2.78%. 
The main churn reason for the Month-to-Month group is: ‘the competitor made the better offer’ or ‘the competitor has better devices’.
For the Two-Year-Contract group, the churn reason: ‘the competitor made a better offer’ is leading, followed closely by product dissatisfaction.
For customers in group contracts (for 2 to 6 people in the group) the churn rate is noticeably lower than for individual clients. In terms of longevity, the longer contracts (24-70 months) have a smaller churn rate for both individual and group types of contracts.
Starting from the age of 60 we observe a significant increase in the churn rate with a dramatic rise in groups 65 and 70 plus.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Databel should work on its competitiveness, especially the quality of its products and the attractiveness of its offer. 
The type of contract needs a closer look – the conditions for month-to-month contracts should be improved to keep customers in. In terms of charges, a better offer should be prepared for individual clients.
For further analysis:
Why does California differ in results from other states?
What are the reasons for churn rate picks in specific age groups?
Why Churn rate is noticeably lower (12.3 %) for customers who use 0-5 GB of data and are not on an unlimited data plan?
